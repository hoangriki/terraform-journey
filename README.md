# Terraform Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning and projects as I prepare for a Infrastrucutre role, with a focus on infrastructure automation, reliability, and production-ready practices.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate **practical experience**, not just completed labs — including design decisions, mistakes, troubleshooting, and lessons learned along the way.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- AWS cloud infrastructure
- Remote state, modules, and environment isolation
- Observability and monitoring foundations
- SRE-oriented workflows and best practices

## 🧭 Why This Repository Exists

Rather than treating learning as disconnected tutorials, this repository serves as:

- A daily engineering journal
- A portfolio of real infrastructure work
